# This bash script gives a rough feeling of the overall rate of the network
# This is achieved by counting all spikes that were emitted via counting the lines of the gdf files
# The rate is the number of spikes divided by time divided by the total number of neurons
# The rate should roughly be somewehere between 10 and 16 Hz
# Note: this probably will not be too accurate with NEST 3 due to the way the spikes are written out. But this has to be checked.
# Run this script by providing the correct path to the simulated data, i.e. change data_dir
# Also: This might take some time, couple of hours? I guess it would be best to run the script inside of a tmux session such that one can disconnect the ssh session and attach to it later when reconnecting.
